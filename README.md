# Python-Weather-Data-Rest-API

I followed the guide from Udemy course. We will create the Rest API from historical data from the Weather Station in Europe. 
The dataset consists of different CSV files from different stations. 
By using a simple URL link, the user can get all the data of the temperature for a specific date and station in dictionary format. 
We will utilize the Flask and pandas library."
