## General Information
This project involves building the REST API from historical data from the Weather Station in Europe. 
We will utilize the Flask library using VS code. In this project, we will only use the `method = get` to send the request. 

## Dataset Information

The dataset was provided in .txt files, containing the weather information of stations located in Europe from 1900 to 2000. 
Also, you can find it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue
